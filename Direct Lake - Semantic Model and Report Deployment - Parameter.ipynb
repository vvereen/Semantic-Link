This specific use case involves maintaining a single master model and report, which are then duplicated across multiple workspaces and Lakehouses to accommodate diverse data sources (e.g., by store). Key benefits include centralized governance, automated deployments, separate source tables (potentially smaller row counts), and reduced need for Row-Level Security (RLS), thereby enhancing performance.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"1aa35ad9-bd0d-487a-9815-0cdde352a766"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install the library in a Fabric notebook: https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-library-in-a-fabric-notebook\n","\n","%pip install semantic-link-labs"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}},"id":"e980d2b1-d896-4ab0-b1ee-82809f1cc2a2"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import the libraries: https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs?tab=readme-ov-file#once-installed-run-this-code-to-import-the-library-into-your-notebook\n","\n","import sempy.fabric as fabric\n","import sempy_labs as labs\n","from sempy_labs import migration, directlake, admin, graph\n","from sempy_labs import lakehouse as lake\n","from sempy_labs import report as rep\n","from sempy_labs.tom import connect_semantic_model\n","from sempy_labs.report import ReportWrapper"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"6173e04d-2809-44bf-a72b-3a0040e2daa2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Programmatically deploy semantic models and reports with Lakehouse schemas"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"90cd0496-c759-48d9-be5a-a9303fcd5ef9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
